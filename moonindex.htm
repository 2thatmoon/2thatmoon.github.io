The Moon {Game}

<p>
A game loosely based on the book, how to be on the moon by Viviane Schwarz and some other stuff</p>

<p>Are You Ready To Rumb...wait. That may be copyrighted. Are You Ready To Run your hand over the mouse as you click and stuff!</p>

<p>Wow, that isn't good. Just start the game.</p>
