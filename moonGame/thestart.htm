<h1>
Happy New Years!
</h1>

<p>
You decided for your New Years resolution to put yourself out there, so you joined a dating app. You figured it was just a fluke, but the day you planned to delete the app, you had to work late. When you logged in, you saw you had a match. Just for funsies, you decided to reply, and ironically enough, you guys hit it off.</p>

<p>You have been talking to {name redacted due to privacy issues} for three months online, and you both have decided it's past due time you meet IRL. {letâ€™s just call them redacted} invites you over for a home-cooked meal and a lively Xbox competition. You agree. Tonight is the night.</p>

<p>{Redacted} told you that you should go old school and print out some google directions to their house as cell signal is known to be spotty because the house is near a cell tower. You get the turn by turn, drive to the neighborhood in question, and park in front of {redacted}'s house.</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>
