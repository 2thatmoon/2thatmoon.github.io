You ring the bell and wait, and ring again, and wait. You repeat this process like 10 more times. nothing happens. Then you pound reall hard, you know just to be sure no one is home. Still dudkus....well that happened

<ul>
   <li> You give a deep sigh and walk back to your car  <a href="runbacktocar.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>You stare at the door longingly, you eyes welling up with tears. All you hope and faith has been crushed forever and you flail to your car (that means run skipping with you hands waving, like those tube guys with the air blowing up them like you find in front of card dealerships, crying) <a href="wasoveritnowhome.htm">}={</a></li>
