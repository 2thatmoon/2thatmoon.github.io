I am not a predator! I swear!
</h1>

<p>A little girl opens the door. She seems like 7 or 8 years' worth of tallness. She says, "Hi, my name is Anna. Would you like to come in? Alligator and I are playing board games.</p>

<ul>
   <li>"I love board games! I can only play a round or two, though." With that inside, you go <a href="livingroom.htm">}={</a></li>
   <li>"Uh...maybe next time?" as you walk away. <a href="walkawayfromanna.htm">}={</a></li>
</ul>
