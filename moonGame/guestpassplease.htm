You walk around the library going in and out of so many rows of books. From outside this place didn't seem nearly as massive as it does now. You see a sign with an arrow just pointing up the stairs. You didn't see a computer on the first floor anywhere so you decide to go upstairs. More books, and more books, and even more books. OMG you think and then you see the glowing blue screen of a computer. You rush over and to your horror see the white fill in box with the blinking cursor and the word PASSWORD in black above it. Next to the montitor you see a sign that says "Dont forget your password is your library card number" ~The Library Staff. Welp, lets go downstairs and ring that bell. You bound down the stairs go back to the desk and ring ring the bell. Nothing happens. You ring it again and look behind you.
