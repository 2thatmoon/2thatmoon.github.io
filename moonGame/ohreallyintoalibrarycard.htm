security

The obvious librarian looks at you and you make a face at them. They then calmly and collectly say I'm sorry sir, you have violated our code of conduct here at The Library and I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Make me you chide back, but before you get the make all the way out the librarian says security. and before you finish me a large minitor has grabbed you and thrown you out the door. as you are collecting yourself off the ground you think wait, that couldn't have been a minitor right? Even thought deep down, you know it was, and wish you had taken the time to make that library card after all.
