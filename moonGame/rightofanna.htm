<h1>
The House to the Right of Anna's house
</h1>

<p>You go next door because the lights are on upstairs. Maybe {redacted} and her  Xbox are up there. I hope she is not the type of person who tries to make it look like all she does is read. Never one to use the internet by having a lot of no-tech stuff downstairs. Then upstairs, it's like a Best Buy on steroids. You ring the doorbell, and the door opens. In front of you is a large wooden placard hanging from the ceiling. It says 'Welcome to the Library" in big fancy letters.</p> 

<ul>
   <li>You go inside. I have a library card. It might work here. <a href="intothelibrary.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>You go inside. I wouldn't mind getting a library card.  <a href="intothelibrary.htm">}={</a></li>

<li>Yeah...If this is {redacted}'s house, I think I'll pass on this date. The last time I checked, this is exactly how horror movies start.<a href="walkawayfrombrary.htm">}={</a></li>
