{redacted} is waiting...but where?

<p>You are standing in the door frame of your car, about to get inside. You look around and wonder what to do next.</p>

<ul>
   <li>At the house right of Anna the upstairs lights are on. Maybe ring the bell. <a href="rightofanna.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>The house left of Anna is completely dark. But, maybe someone is home. <a href="leftofanna.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>Across the street from Anna, all the lights are on. Maybe try over at that house. <a href="acrossofanna.htm">}={</a></li>
