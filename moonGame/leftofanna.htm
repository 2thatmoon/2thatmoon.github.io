The House to the Left of Anna's house
</h1>

<p>You go to the house to the left of Anna's house. All the lights are off. It looks eerie as all get out. You walk up to the door, take a deep breath and ring the doorbell. You don't hear anything. You look down in confusion and see a post-it on the ground that says that the doorbell is currently broken. It must have fallen off the door.</p>
